# Elisions in Ancient Greek

List of elided words – given both in their elided and in their full forms – occurring in Ancient Greek texts.

This list was created while dealing with elisions in Athenaeus. The initial data have been extracted from the Perseus version of Kaibel's edition (as of 2019-04-06).

The more generic, corpus-independent list is partly based on earlier work on stopwords.
